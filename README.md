Submerge — Unified Subdomain Recon &amp; Deduplication
Submerge is a lightweight recon tool that runs multiple subdomain enumerators (Kali packages and GitHub tools like subfinder, amass, assetfinder), aggregates and normalizes their results, removes duplicates, and outputs a single ready-to-use unique_subdomains.txt for downstream scanning.
